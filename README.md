# Financial Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on financial news articles and market reports using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By building and fine-tuning a custom model, we aim to classify financial texts as positive, negative, or neutral to provide actionable market insights.

## Objectives
- Analyze financial texts for sentiment classification.
- Build and fine-tune a model to detect market sentiment with high accuracy.
- Deliver meaningful insights to interpret market trends and investor behavior.

## Setup and Installation
To start working on this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-sentiment-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd financial-sentiment-analysis
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data Preprocessing and Preparation
The data is preprocessed to ensure it is clean and ready for model training:
- Text cleaning and normalization steps are performed to remove noise.
- Data is split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

## Model Architecture and Training
The model is built using an advanced Transformer-based architecture, optimized and fine-tuned for financial sentiment classification tasks.

## Evaluation Metrics
Performance is measured using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## Future Improvements
- Additional data sources can be integrated to improve model generalizability.
- Different model architectures and optimization techniques can be explored for higher accuracy.

## Future Work & Improvements
- Expand the dataset with additional financial texts to enhance model generalizability.
- Experiment with different Transformer-based models for potential performance improvements.
- Explore multi-class sentiment classification and more granular sentiment categories.
